Tinyscan (by Andre Sobotta)

The goal of this Project is a small Desktop 3D-Scanner, 
using a linelaser, Ardurino-board, a stepper-motor and a Webcam.


Things Tinyscan can do:
- generate an 3D-Pointcloud out of a series of pictures from the same 
object rotating around its z-axis 
-calibrate itself, using two pictures


Things Tinyscan will do(in the future):
- taking pictures from a webcam
- control the scanner hardware
- remeshing the Pointcloud


Things Tinyscan won't do:
- generate a pointcloud out of random pictures from the same object


Have fun with it!
