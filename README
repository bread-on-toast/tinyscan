Tinyscan (by Andre Sobotta)

The goal of this Project is a small Desktop 3D-Scanner, 
using a linelaser and a Webcam.


Things Tinyscan can do(now):
- generate an 3D-Pointcloud out of a series of pictures(SVG) from the same 
object with paralel laserlines projectet on it

Things Tinyscan will do(in the future):
- calibrate itself
- taking pictures from a webcam(V4L2)
- control the scanner hardware
- remeshing the Pointcloud


Things Tinyscan won't do:
- generate a pointcloud out of random pictures from the same object


Have fun with it!
